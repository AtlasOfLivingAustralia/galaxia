<h2>Create Darwin-Core Archives in R</h2>

`Galaxias` is an R package designed to simplify the process of converting
biodiversity data into [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org) archives (DwC-A),
facilitating data submission to infrastructures such as the [Atlas of Living
Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au) and the [Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF)](https://gbif.org). The key features include:

- Check and conform data columns and values to meet Darwin Core standards
- Automatic metafile creation
- User friendly workflow for creating a resource metadata document (`eml.xml`)
using simple markdown
- Final export of a compressed (`ZIP`) DwC-A from the above components

## Quick start

This package is under active development, and is not yet available on CRAN. You
can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```r
devtools::install_github("atlasoflivingaustralia/galaxias")
```

Load the package:

```r
library(galaxias)
```

## What is Darwin Core?

Darwin Core (DwC) is a standardised framework used for compiling biodiversity
data, and is maintained by the Biodiversity Information Standards group
(https://www.tdwg.org). As a data standard, DwC facilitates the sharing and use
of open-access biodiversity data, and is used by GBIF and it's node member
organisations. 

In practice, the DwC standards and terms are used to create a single,
self-contained dataset, known as a Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A). The format of
this archive is a `ZIP` file containing text files of data and metadata, and
represents the fundamental unit required to share DwC compliant biodiversity
data.

A DwC-A can contain a range of different files, but there are three main files that are required:

- A data core: A core dataset, such as an Occurrence or Event core
- `eml.xml`: A resource metadata file describing the dataset, in the Ecological
  Metadata Language (EML) format
- `meta.xml`: A metadata file describing the structure and relationships of
files within the archive
  
## What does `galaxias` do? And who is it for?

The collection of field-based biological observations is widespread across a
range of scientific disiplines. The importance and value in sharing this data
for re-use is well understood by the research community. However, various
constraints such as limited time, or unfamiliarity with the standards and data
structures required by online services such as the ALA and GBIF, can hinder user
contributions. 

The aim of `galaxias` is therefore to facilitate the sharing of data, by
streamlining the process of creating a DwC-A from field-based biological
observations, for submission to online data infrastructures such as the ALA. As
an R package, `galaxias` can integrate seamlessly with existing workflows,
making the process of submitting data to online services as fast and seamless as
possible. 

We provide tools to assist with the creation and compliance of the three main
components required by a DwC-A:

- Core data file: 
  - Generate a summary report of the data's compatibility with Darwin Core
  required fields and formats
  - Import or create a lookup table (dictionary) for mapping column headings
  with Darwin Core terms. 
  - Tools to assist with conforming data to the DwC standards (fill missing
  fields, convert to required formats, etc.)
- Automatic descriptor metafile (`meta.xml`) creation
- Resource metadata document (`eml.xml`):
  - Create and edit the required resource metadata file using simple markdown
  and our provided template, with tools for converting to and from `xml`
- Final export of a compressed (`ZIP`) DwC-A from the above components

A function to allow direct upload of DwC-As to the ALA via API is also in
progress.

## Example workflow

Starting with our core data file, we will import observation data into R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
occurrence_data <- read.csv(
  system.file("data/westerband_2022_wdate.csv", package = "galaxias")
)
```

We can then perform a check of this data using `check_fields()`. Primarily, this
function checks for the presence of columns that comply with DwC terms. This
check is also interactive, and can be used to correct any issues with some of
our supported fixes (e.g. unique identifiers, date formats (TBD)).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(galaxias)
occurrence_data_out <- check_fields(occurrence_data)
```

A report is shown in the console, and you could then use this report to fix any
issues reported. By default, presence of both DwC required and recommended
fields (for Occurrence data) is checked. But we can also specify
check_fields(data, all_fields = FALSE) to check only the required fields.  

Once you are happy with how your data is formatted, and all required fields have
been detected, we can then create a lookup table (dictionary) for mapping column
headings with Darwin Core terms. This is done using `create_lookup_table()`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(purrr)

# Opens metadata template interactively in RStudio for you to edit
# By default, this function copies the template to the root of your project directory
# Feel free to move this file to where you see fit
edit_metadata_md()

# Read completed template back into R
# Specify the path to the metadata template file
# For purpose of demo, will read example md
md_template <- read_metadata_md("inst/markdown/westerband_template.md")

# Convert md_text into tibble
md_tibble <- md_to_tibble(md_template)

# Convert tibble into list
# This step preps the metadata text so that
# it can easily interact with the XML template
md_list <- md_tibble_to_list(md_tibble)

# Retrieve blank eml list structure (stored internally in package)
eml_template_list
str(eml_template_list)

# Update fields in eml_template_list
# Currently implemented for Title and Name only
eml_template_updated <-
  update_title(eml_template_list, md_list) |>
  update_names(md_list)

# Preview updated changes
eml_template_updated |> pluck("eml", "dataset", "title")
eml_template_updated |> pluck("eml", "dataset", "contact")
```

Finally, we run ..., which builds the `meta.xml` file and packages the archive:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# In progress currently implemented for the occurrence data only
DwC_occurrence_data <- tibble(
  basisOfRecord = "HUMAN_OBSERVATION",
  scientificName = "Galaxias maculatus",
  eventDate = "2002-12-07",
  decimalLatitude = -33.366551,
  decimalLongtitude = 151.47635
)

make_core_xml(DwC_occurrence_data,
  file_name = "DwC_occurrence.csv"
)
```

## In progress

- The current aim is a MVP, no warranty provided way to create a DwC archive
- The packge will have a main function entry point
- There are two main user facing processes:
  - Check (validate)
  - Modify (basic modifications to data where possible)
  - Build (zip)
- There are three products required for a DwC archive:
  - data.csv
  - meta.xml
  - eml.xml
