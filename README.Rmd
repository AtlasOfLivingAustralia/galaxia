## Overview

`galaxias` is an R package designed to simplify the process of converting
biodiversity data into [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org) archives (DwCA),
facilitating data submission to infrastructures such as the [Atlas of Living
Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au) and the [Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF)](https://gbif.org).

## Installation
This package is under active development, and is not yet available on CRAN. You
can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("atlasoflivingaustralia/galaxias")
```

Load the package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(galaxias)
```

## Functions

`galaxias` supports you to:
* Read and write relevant file types such as markdown (using `read_md()` and `write_md()`), or full archives (using `read_dwca()` or `write_dwca()`).
* Use piped syntax to build an archive, starting a pipe with `gofish()` and adding elements with `add_` functions (particularly `add_occurrences()`, `add_metadata()`).
* Pass these files to relevant APIs using `validate()` or `publish()`.
