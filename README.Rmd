<h2>Create Darwin-Core Archives in R</h2>

`galaxias` is an R package designed to simplify the process of converting
biodiversity data into [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org) archives (DwCA),
facilitating data submission to infrastructures such as the [Atlas of Living
Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au) and the [Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF)](https://gbif.org).

## Installation
This package is under active development, and is not yet available on CRAN. You
can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("atlasoflivingaustralia/galaxias")
devtools::load_all()
```

Load the package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# library(galaxias)
```


## Basic usage
To construct a Darwin Core Archive, you'll need two things:

 - some biodiversity data, ideally in a csv or similar
 - a metadata statement saying what the data is, and who owns it (usually you, the submitter)

Below we'll provide a quick example of each element. 

### Biodiversity data
At their most simple, Darwin Core Archives contain observations of biodiversity, 
known as "occurrences". They may *also* contain additional information, such as 
how your survey events were structured, or what images, sounds or videos you 
took; we will cover these in later vignettes. An occurrence dataset is a table 
where each row is an observation, and each column is a feature of that you
observed:

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  occurrenceID = c("galaxias-example-01", "galaxias-example-02"),
  decimalLatitude = c(-35.310, -35.273),
  decimalLongitude = c(149.125, 149.133),
  # coordinatePrecision ?
  eventDate = c("14-01-2023T0:23::00Z", "15-01-2023T11:25:00Z"),
  scientificName = c("Callocephalon fimbriatum", "Eolophus roseicapilla"),
  taxonRank = "species",
  basisOfRecord = "humanObservation")
```

Note that normally you'd import your data from an external file (e.g. reading a 
`.csv` file with `utils::read.csv()` or `readr::read_csv()`), but we've 
constructed one here for example purposes.

The columns of your dataset need to conform to the Darwin Core Standard; 
typically this will require some renaming and perhaps some data manipulation, 
as described in the `Mapping to Darwin Core` vignette. There are a lot of Darwin 
Core terms, but you probably won't need them all. You can find out more using 
the `{tawnydragon}` package, most easily using the function 
`tawnydragon::view_terms()`.

### Metadata
Darwin Core Archives use `xml` files to store metadata, but this format is 
tricky to work with for data entry. Therefore, we suggest that you store your 
metadata as a markdown file, and use `read_md()` and `write_md()` to migrate 
between markdown and xml:

```{r}
get_blank_metadata() |>
  write_md("test.rmd") # also supports `.qmd` suffix
```

If you'd prefer a bit more guidance on what to include, you can use an existing 
metadata entry as an example, and modify it to your needs:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_example_metadata(id = "df368") |>
  write_md("example.rmd")
```

Storing metadata in markdown files has several advantages over xml:

- **clarity:** markdown is easy to read and edit
- **persistence:** markdown files live in your file structure rather than your R environment, so
  are easy to store, share and update
- **visualisation:** it is straightforward to render the file as a PDF or HTML for viewing or sharing

Once you are done editting your markdwown file, use `read_md()` to import back 
into R as an `xml` object:

```{r}
metadata <- read_md("test.rmd")
```

### Constructing an archive

In `galaxias`, we construct Darwin Core Archives by adding data to a single 
object, created using the `dwca()` function:


```{r}
archive <- dwca() |>
  add_occurrences(df) |>
  add_metadata(metadata)

archive

```

We suggest using piped syntax. The sequence in which arguments are added doesn't
matter this time, but would matter if you were adding multiple different kinds 
of data. See the `Structure of DwCAs` vignette for details.

### Checking and submitting

`galaxias` provides two ways to check a DwCA; locally and online. We suggest
using both, in sequence, to avoid any surprises. 

To check a `dwca` object locally, use `check_dwca()`:
```{r}
# check_dwca(archive)
```

*Q: Include a report option?*

Once you've checked your object locally, you can use `build_dwca()` to convert
it into a 'real' DwCA (i.e. a `.zip` file). 

```{r}
archive |>
  build_dwca("my_dwca.zip")
```

The validate function takes a DwCA as an input, and passes it to to the ALA 
validation API for checking. 

*Q: function name to 'submit' data?*
