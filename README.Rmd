## Overview

`galaxias` is an R package that helps users standardize, document and share 
biodiversity information using the ['Darwin Core'](https://dwc.tdwg.org) data 
standard. It supports users to set up repositories in a standardised way;
provides tools and examples for how to use the Darwin Core standard; and allows 
remote validation and publication of said data via API. `galaxias` was built, 
and is maintained, by the 
[Science & Decision Support Team](https://labs.ala.org.au) at the 
[Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au) (ALA).

The package is named for a genus of freshwater fish that is found only in the 
Southern Hemisphere, and predominantly in Australia and New Zealand.
