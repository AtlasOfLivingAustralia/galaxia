          Climate data were extracted for each site from the eMAST data
          project. Soil data were measured for a subset of sites and
          extracted from the CSIRO SoilGrids for the remaining sites.
          Environmental/experimental conditions: All data were collected
          on native plant species growing under natural conditions in
          the field.

          Ci:Ca values less than 0 or greater than 1 were excluded, as
          were stomatal conductance values greater than 3000 millimol
          per square meter per second. Vcmax 25 values greater than 500
          micromol CO2 per square meter per second were also excluded
          from the final analysis.

          Light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were measured at
          ambient CO2 levels using a portable gas exchange system.
          Stomatal conductance to water vapor and Ci:Ca correspond to
          light-saturated rates of photosynthesis. Carboxylation
          capacity, Vcmax, was estimated via the one-point method when
          it was not provided from A-ci curves. Concentrations of leaf
          nitrogen and phosphorus were measured using an elemental
          analyzer. LMA was measured by dividing the leaf dry mass by
          the surface area of a fresh leaf.

          Raw data were used to calculate species means for all sites,
          which were then compiled to produce one data file. This was
          done using RStudio Version 1.3.959
