        Light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were measured at ambient
        CO2 levels using a portable gas exchange system. Stomatal
        conductance to water vapor and Ci:Ca correspond to
        light-saturated rates of photosynthesis. Carboxylation capacity,
        Vcmax, was estimated via the one-point method when it was not
        provided from A-ci curves. Concentrations of leaf nitrogen and
        phosphorus were measured using an elemental analyzer. LMA was
        measured by dividing the leaf dry mass by the surface area of a
        fresh leaf.

        Raw data were used to calculate species means for all sites,
        which were then compiled to produce one data file. This was done
        using RStudio Version 1.3.959
