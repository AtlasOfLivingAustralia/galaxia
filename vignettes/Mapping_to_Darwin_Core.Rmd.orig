The most important part of building a Darwin Core Archive is mapping your 
dataset to the column names - and associated contents - required by the standard.
This vignette discusses some common ways to do this.

## Darwin Core terms
Before we start making changes, it would be useful to know what the valid 
Darwin Core terms are. We can find this out using `dwc_terms()`.

## Converting a dataset to DwC-compliance
The most reliable and reproducible way to manipulate data into a Darwin
Core-compatible format is by constructing a data manipulation workflow. This 
allows you to control all aspects of the dataset, and is much more reproducible 
than automated approaches.

Let's work with a simple example - a dataset of two biodiversity observations.
While we've built this in the browser using `tibble` for convenience, a more 
common use case is to have this information stored in a `.csv` file which is 
imported with `readr::read_csv()`. Our example looks like this:

```{r}
library(tibble)

df <- tibble(
  latitude = c(-35.310, -35.273),
  longitude = c(149.125, 149.133),
  date = c("14-01-2023", "15-01-2023"),
  time = c("10:23", "11:25"),
  species = c("Callocephalon fimbriatum", "Eolophus roseicapilla"),
  n = c(2, 3)
)
```
This is exactly the sort of data we might reasonably expect to share through
a biodiversity repository, with some minor exceptions:

- the field (column) names don't match the Darwin Core standard
- `date` and `time` are shown together rather than separately
- some potentially useful fields are missing, such as who collected the data

A standard data manipulation workflow 
to amend our data might include the following steps:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(glue)
library(lubridate)

dwc_df <- df |>

  # rename columns
  rename(decimalLatitude = latitude,
         decimalLongitude = longitude,
         scientificName = species,
         individualCount = n) |>
         
  # amend date column to standard format
  mutate(date = dmy(date)) |>
  
  # add previously missing information supported or required by Darwin Core
  mutate(occurrenceID = seq_len(nrow(df)),
         eventDate = glue("{date}T{time}:00Z"),
         taxonRank = "species",
         basisOfRecord = "humanObservation",
         recordedBy = "Martin Westgate",
         ) |>
         
  # place columns in a sensible order
  select(occurrenceID, eventDate, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude,
         scientificName, taxonRank, individualCount, recordedBy,
         basisOfRecord)

dwc_df
```
As you can see above, this approach is fully reproducible, and is very clear
about how data is manipulated and added at each stage. It also allows you to 
check carefully that each field contains the correct information.


## Populating taxonomic fields
One thing that is missing from our earlier example is detailed additional 
taxonomic information. You can auto-populate this by looking up your supplied 
species names in your preferred taxonomic database, e.g.

```{r}
library(galah)

taxonomy <- dwc_df |>
  pull(scientificName) |>
  search_taxa()
taxonomy
```

```{r}
## Next:
  # remove non-DwC terms
  # reformat columns to camelCase
  # left_join() with dwc_df
```

This has the added benefit of showing how the atlas in question will 
interpret your provided taxonomic information. This can be useful for 
taxonomically ambiguous groups where more care may be required to ensure 
correct interpretation.
