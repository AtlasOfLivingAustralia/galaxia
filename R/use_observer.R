#' Add who made an observation to a `tibble`
#' 
#' Format fields that contain information about who made a specific observation 
#' of an organism.
#' 
#' In practice this is no different from using `mutate()`, but gives some 
#' informative errors, and serves as a useful lookup for fields in 
#' the Darwin Core Standard.
#' @param df a `data.frame` or `tibble` that the column should be appended to.
#' @param recordedBy Names of people, groups, or organizations responsible for 
#' recording the original occurrence. The primary collector or observer should 
#' be listed first.
#' @param recordedByID The globally unique identifier for the person, people, 
#' groups, or organizations responsible for recording the original occurrence.
#' @param .keep Control which columns from .data are retained in the output. 
#' Note that unlike `dplyr::mutate`, which defaults to `"all"` this defaults to 
#' `"unused"`; i.e. only keeps Darwin Core fields, and not those fields used to 
#' generate them.
#' @returns A tibble with the requested fields added.
#' @details
#' Examples of `recordedBy` values:
#' * `Jos√© E. Crespo`
#' 
#' Examples of `recordedByID` values:
#' * 	`c("https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097", "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0098")`
