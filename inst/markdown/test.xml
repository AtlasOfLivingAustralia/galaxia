      <para>
        Climate data were extracted for each site from the eMAST data
        project. Soil data were measured for a subset of sites and
        extracted from the CSIRO SoilGrids for the remaining sites.
        Environmental/experimental conditions: All data were collected
        on native plant species growing under natural conditions in the
        field.

          Ci:Ca values less than 0 or greater than 1 were excluded, as
          were stomatal conductance values greater than 3000 millimol
          per square meter per second. Vcmax 25 values greater than 500
          micromol CO2 per square meter per second were also excluded
          from the final analysis.

      <para>
        Light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were measured at ambient
        CO2 levels using a portable gas exchange system. Stomatal
        conductance to water vapor and Ci:Ca correspond to
        light-saturated rates of photosynthesis. Carboxylation capacity,
        Vcmax, was estimated via the one-point method when it was not
        provided from A-ci curves. Concentrations of leaf nitrogen and
        phosphorus were measured using an elemental analyzer. LMA was
        measured by dividing the leaf dry mass by the surface area of a
        fresh leaf.
      </para>
      <para>
        Raw data were used to calculate species means for all sites,
        which were then compiled to produce one data file. This was done
        using RStudio Version 1.3.959
