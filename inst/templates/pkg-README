# {{{ Project }}}`

This is a packaged dataset containing information on ...

This repository is formatted as a *Biodiversity Data Package*, a simple format 
that allows data owners to export their data as both an *R package* that users 
can install in their R session, and as a **Darwin Core Archive**, a global
standard this is used by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and its'
partner nodes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {{{ Project }}} like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Citing

You can cite this package as follows:

Lastname, Firstname (YEAR) My Data Package is Awesome, version x.x.xx

You can add a citation to your package using `usethis::use_citation()` or
`galaxias::use_bd_citation()`.


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you what data is contained in the package:

```{r example}
library(testpackage)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
